<p class="alt">"Umber captures the spirit of nature — its glory and grace — in her beautifully crafted, mixed media comics." —<strong>Alyssa Berg</strong>, author of Alpenglow<br><br>"Maggie Umber’s 270° is beautiful to experience and the narrative engrossing. I was pulled in to the reality of the Owls. A fascinating read, gorgeously depicted." —<strong>Mike Dawson</strong>, author of Why Did They Come? <br><br>"When 270º, Maggie Umber’s second beautifully illustrated book on owls reached me I could not put it down until I had absorbed all its delightful owl and other artwork from cover to cover. This book will turn heads and make the viewers turn pages. The playful layout and creative and diverse artwork seduces the reader into absorbing the subtle but factual information woven throughout these pages. The words sometimes blend into the images, like grass, twigs and branches of the owls’ habitats. Maggie has created a book of owls that reminds even the most objective owl scientists like me that there are other aesthetically pleasing ways to know owls." —<strong>Dr. James Duncan</strong>, Balmoral, Manitoba, Canada</p>

<p><span>"Excessive, mysterious, wonderful, Juliacks work takes the graphic novel to a new and more plastic dimension." </span><span>—<strong>Chris Kraus</strong>, author of <em>I Love Dick</em>, <em>Torpor</em>, <em>Summer of Hate</em><br></span><br><span>"Juliacks is a comic artist whose work—crude, ornate, subjective and dreamy—is not for those who prefer their narrative crisp and tidy." </span><span>—<strong>The New York Times</strong></span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><span class="italic">"ARCHITECTURE OF AN ATOM is a long, deep breath before a dive. It’s a Piscean tale of survival, harrowing and surreal, a dreamlike escape, a delight. Dive into this pool of misfits and watch how wreckage becomes magic, hunger becomes adventure, and human questions about love, intimacy, and community unravel and manifest in beautiful washes of color. The language matches the vibrancy of the drawings and paintings that describes a cast of characters surviving on the brink of a disaster, in the end forming a magnificent poetic experience." </span>—<strong>Sally Wen Mao</strong>, author of <em>Mad Honey Symposium</em></span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Juliacks is an artist, filmmaker, performer-choreographer, cartoonist, and playwright who splits her time between New Jersey, where she recently received a 2016 Fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and the Netherlands. She's been published and performed in various cities across North America and throughout Europe, her most recent project being the trans-media story Architecture of an Atom.</span></p>

<div class="col6 padem13h">
<p class="alt">"Comets Comets is a mini drawn by Larmee in his Young Lions/C.F. style, featuring an interview conducted by an unnamed young woman and "celebrity artist couple" Hall Hassi and Davidson Middle. Not surprisingly, it's an imaginary interview with imaginary artists who discuss their imaginary careers using celebrity in conjunction with feminism, using tools like webcams to disseminate their work far and wide. Larmee deliberately uses heavy colors to obscure some of the lettering in the comic, refusing to grant the reader the privilege of knowing all that was said among the three characters. Hassi is an extended internet creation of Larmee's, who loves playing with the concepts of identity, fame and creation in an internet world where fame is arbitrary and viral, identity can shift or easily be hidden and manipulated, and repurposing art and images is more rampant now than ever." —Rob Clough</p>

<h3>
<strong>56pp <br></strong><strong>12 × 8" <br>b&amp;w, 1 color, CMYK offset <br>hardcover<br>printed by Regent in China</strong>
</h3>
<p>A CAT LOVES A BOY. </p>
<p>He says he loves you too</p>
<p>"I fucking love you I fucking love you I fucking love you"</p>
<p>Can you believe it? Copy Kitty!</p>
<p>Hop in his convertible, and take a ride , Copy Kitty! Road-runner in the rear-view mirror. Paint his portrait! Wear your pearls! He's beautiful, isn't he?</p>
<p>Exquisite, intricate graphite drawings in landscape view. Chock-full of hidden details, little worlds of signification. Beautiful, opulent, emotional. </p>
<p><span>REVIEWS FOR COPY KITTY: </span></p>
<p><span>“...intricate, hypnotic…” —<strong>Selena Gallery</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>“A shimmering fake moon, opulent costume changes, and Depression-era Art Deco set the backdrop for this spellbinding new narrative from Kyung-Me.” —<strong>The Editorial Magazine</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>REVIEWS FOR CONIUNCTIO: </span></p>
<p><span>“Kyung-Me’s ultra-precise ink drawings, which resemble both Renaissance etchings and finely wrought computer-generated renderings, are windows into starkly glamorous modernist interiors.” —<strong>The New Yorker</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>“In a series of grayscale drawings, Kyung-Me renders every wood grain and textile fiber with ink, charcoal, or graphite in crisp detail, with no loss from foreground to background. The meticulous clarity is dizzying, even hallucinatory. With no singular focus or discernible narrative, the subjectless interior induces a horror vacui through its elaborate, often competing patterns.” —<strong>The Offing </strong></span></p>
<p><span>REVIEWS FOR BAD KOREAN: </span></p>
<p><span>“A charmingly self-deprecating show, Bad Korean is a deeply personal exploration of feeling alienated from both one’s own body and one’s environment. Kyung-Me’s sketches initially appear rough and hurried, with loose outlines and plain washes of color that carelessly overstep their bounds. Her facial expressions are an exception. Consistently illustrated with profound sensitivity, her drawn avatar’s face elucidates a complex conflation of conflicted feelings. She offers a rare feminist window into second-generation intersectionality, achieved at a human scale.” —<strong>Hyperallergic</strong></span></p>
<p><span>“Kyung-Me’s drawings, rendered in colored pencil and pastel on paper, show flattened visions of everyday life in New York — images of being optimistic and confused and gross and lonely and lost and hungry and in love.” —<strong>Huffington Post</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>An adult picture book comprised of intricate, surreal graphite illustrations that tell the tale of obsessive love and longing and the maddening, self-inflicted contortions of identity endured to fit perceived expectations and norms.</span></p>
<p><span>Copy Kitty explores themes of identity, belonging and love through a cat who painfully and continually reinvents itself in pursuit of adoration and an elusive ideal. Autobiographically driven, the narrative strikes a chord through common experiences conveyed authentically, with sharp perspective and deep reflection on the self-destructive consequences of perceived ideals and sublimation of identity.</span></p>
<p><span>The format of the book presents each of the highly detailed illustrations alternating with a blank page. Copy Kitty is based on a series of illustrations Kyung-Me exhibited at galleries in New York, which were met with strong critical acclaim. In 2018, work from Copy Kitty was featured in Artspace, having been selected on the favorites list from the New York NADA preview by prominent art collectors Susan and Michael Hort.</span></p>
<p><span>Kyung-Me is an artist and illustrator living in New York. She is represented by Bureau, NY.  She holds an MFA in painting from the Yale School of Art and has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions in New York galleries and beyond. She is best known for her series of illustrations and debut graphic novel, Bad Korean, critically acclaimed by Vice, Huffington Post, and Hyperallergic.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p class="alt">"'Extended Play' is an apt title. The pleasure of Terrell's line, and his storytelling, is infectious. It’s a battle cry for cartooning as mark making, as line design, for thinking of drawing as handwriting and a form of searching and discovery. It may be his first book, but already he seems to understand what IT is, better than most. I could read his work all day long." —Sammy Harkham</p>
<p class="alt">Extended Play, the debut collection by Jake Terrell, seizes upon the millennial zeitgeist from an array of angles. From the haze of summer to the conflicting feelings of ennui and hope that guide the figures in Terrell’s magical realist landscapes, there’s an effortlessness to his work that obscures the heightened sense of understanding he brings to the form. Jake Terrell is a cartoonist and illustrator based in Brooklyn, NY. His comics have a loose, confident line, often focusing on a youth-centric cast of characters written into magical realist or measured fantastical narratives.</p>

<p class="alt">"Anyone can feel the soft, painful vulnerability in Fifi Martinez’s work. The brash depictions of her personal relationships and lonely, depressive internal monologue emit an honest intensity that can make anyone reflect on their past life with tears. Her frantic line work and obsessive layering carries the reader through the anxiety of her life. Fifi’s persistent growth as an artist and person can only inspire hope in the insecure and miserable." — <strong>Lizz Hickey</strong>, author of Jammers</p>
<p class="alt">A small zine that feels like a cassette demo, filled with short unfinished first take tracks about love, heartbreak, and feelings.<br><br>Past lovers bleed into one another as moody sketches and hazy memories.

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>"I think Leif Goldberg made Lost in the Fun Zone using automatic writing—after absorbing all art of the twentieth century and comics from the past forty years. How else do you get Dubuffet, synthetic cubism, Garfield, Italian Futurism, Luis Buñuel, and Gary Panter in a story about two cats traveling a digressive and banal path to nowhere? It's boldly weird. Goldberg has hijacked the comics form, for its benefit and ours." —<strong>Nicole Rudick,</strong> Managing Editor at The Paris Review</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span class="italic">"Alleluia!!! Our favorite Artist has made a Graphic novel unlike any other. Going Commando in Black'n'White Rodeo style, the better to spin his lasso spiderweb of narrative, Goldberg performs the great trick of steering time neatly down two railroad tracks. A metamorphosis per page, at the speed of synapses sprouting digression radicles... This story echoes, spins, and convulses with a thousand sweaty puns- you will laff on the bus, in the bathroom, and at Harvard. Truly unlike no other artist in the galaxy (Borblefluzz is related).... Do you want to understand the world by walking through a pumpkin? Is your favorite drug Funny Animals?... Well then get "Get Lost"!!!! To Find Yourself!! in the Fun Zone!!!" </span><span>—<strong>Matthew Thurber</strong></span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Lost in the Fun Zone is the long-awaited debut graphic novel from respected underground printmaker, animator, musician, and zinemaker Leif Goldberg. Transposing buddy and road film dynamics into the world of underground art comics, Goldberg adroitly balances absurdism with cultural snark and art history commentary to produce a book worthy of its name.<br><br>Leif Goldberg is a visual artist and musician living in Vermont. As a member of the highly influential art-collective Fort Thunder based in Providence, RI in the late 1990's and early 2000's, Goldberg is known for his bold screenprint work as well as experimental animation and contributions to the band Forcefield, who were part of the 2002 Whitney Biennial.</span></p>

<p class="alt">"Haunting, disturbing, breathtaking and beautiful — this is a story that will stay with you." <br>—<strong>MariNaomi</strong></p>
<p class="alt">"Archie’s scratchy, understated line unerringly evokes helplessness, violation, and a lingering sense of psychic revulsion, dropping the presumed morals out from under you and then implicating you in the inevitable disaster.

</div>
<div class="col6 padem13h">
<p class="alt">Out of Hollow Water, the debut book by Archie Bongiovanni, is an exercise in the fantastical and intensely personal, plumbing hidden depths both real and imagined. It is a work that wanders into the dark recesses of the female experience, where the only escape is through cathartic release, taking myriad forms. This book draws and expands upon themes Bongiovanni has cultivated in past works, while signaling a shift in presentation. Moving from the rough, scratchy inked pages of their minicomics to the hazy imperfection of pencil on vellum, Bongiovanni has constructed a space befitting their oblique narratives. This triptych of stories showcases a stark, emergent voice in the ever growing world of comics, one worth following down whatever path they might take you.</p>

<div class="col6 padem13h">
<p class="alt">This is an audacious debut by Parrish. It's interesting that Dash Shaw offered up a blurb, because among the many influences that Parrish cycled through in the course of this book, Shaw was the most significant. The layout, the use of diagramatic text, the use of textual onomatopoeia in place of more typical sounds effects, and simple line are all there--except when they're not. Eleanor Davis is another obvious influence, and there may be hints of Gary Panter, Chris Ware and many others. What's remarkable is the way they are able to dial in and out of a particular visual style, often in the middle of a story. In "Train Scene", Parrish begins with a naturalistic color setting at the station, then switches to a pencils-only page, and then to the big, blobby character design they use for much of the book. In other words, the "real" image, the self-image, and the way she looks at others. The result is a style for Parrish that becomes uniquely theirs, whipping the reader from narrative fragment to narrative fragment while still retaining a cohesive set of character profiles.</p>

<p>Qviet focuses on the abstractions of sex, of seeing, and the fluid relations between the two. Using the strip, one of the oldest formal modes in comics, as the misleadingly benign container for his explorations, Burkholder challenges the reader to reimagine not only what falls under the purview of this form, but the larger conceptions of sex as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Burkholder<span> </span></b>is a cartoonist and visual artist. His comics are abstract yet playful, oftentimes dealing with very adult themes twisted through an extremely dry sense of humor. His 2013 comic Pretty Smart was included in the Jonathan Lethem edited Best American Comics 2015.</p>

<p class="alt">"Jaakko Pallasvuo has a gift for rendering the anxiety of contemporary life with complicated sincerity. He blends art-world satire and queer tragedy with a cosmic sensibility that can ruminate on ecological deep time and crack absurdist jokes on the same page. Retreat is his most accomplished comic to date: an ambitious, fully-realized post-apocalypse narrative in lush, impressionistic watercolour. Like everything he makes, I adore it." —<strong>Saelan Twerdy</strong>, critic</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p class="alt">"Currently nothing excites me more than a new project from Jaakko. I don't care if he's making films, masks, comics or papier mache hats, I'm in for anything, but I'm very happy he's come back so strongly to comics over the past few years. I generally find his stories of 'pretentious groups of art-people' to be actually very unpretentious and quite matter of fact. I found RETREAT to be propulsive and full of emotion and 'social action'. It made me feel for the characters. It felt real. And most importantly: I LOL'd. &lt;|:-) (i heard a rumour that james van der beek purchased the screenplay rights in a secret google hangout.)" —<strong>Simon Hanselmann</strong>, author of Seeds and Stems</p>
<p class="alt">The angst, ennui, and malaise of the queer apocalypse sublimated to the equally ravishing graphic novel.<br><br>A gay couple flees the city from the impending apocalypse. They meet another artist on the way. Their clashing relationships, emotions, ideologies, hopes, and plans all transform unpredictably at the twilight of the human race. Jaakko Pallasvuo tells the convoluted and beautiful drama in the face of oblivion with stunning colors and visual and literal innovations in the way that are only possible in contemporary comics.<br></p>
<p class="alt">Jaakko Pallasvuo is a Finnish artist and novelist working in painting, sculpture, video, photography, books, and digital media. He has exhibited his work all around the world including Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, Berlin, London, Paris, Stockholm, Warsaw, and Seoul. His previous graphic novels are Pure Shores and Easy Rider, both by British artist book publisher Landfill Editions.<br></p>

<p class="alt">Rudy, a collection spanning over 20 years of comics and zines by Mark Connery, is a delightfully strange, funny, and metaphysical trip.

<p class="alt">"Max is such a good observer of interpersonal relations, and therefore a great storyteller. Needless to say that his drawings are magnetic. I keep staring at them and think: How did he do that? Röhner is one of my favorite books." —Anna Haifisch, author of The Artist<br></p>
<p class="alt">"Designs whole worlds with a few lines." —Sabine Danek, Critic<br></p>
<p class="alt">Baitinger leaves the reader in the dark about the big picture. He prefers to show details: how the protagonist spins his appointment calendar in the air to indicate that he has no time. The way aluminium confetti pours out of a letter onto a shag rug. Baitinger breaks up an everyday matter like brewing coffee into many small steps, each in an individual image: ‘Switch on boiler. Insert pot. Fill tank. Insert filter. — Josa Mania-Schlegel, journalist at Krautreporter<br></p>
<p class="alt">Previously published in German by Rotopol Press, Röhner is a delightfully detailed field guide to the every day tasks of living in an apartment — making coffee, watering plants, and maintaining order and a careful balance with neighbors — until that order is upset.</p>
<p class="alt">Max Baitinger’s dry humor and precise drawings deftly personify his über persnickety protagonist, simply referred to as P., whose regimented life is disrupted by the arrival of Röhner, an unloved houseguest, who imposes upon his psyche and offsets the careful balance with his gregarious, omnipresent neighbor. Devious tricks and hilarious imaginations of Röhner’s elimination take shape, from painstakingly making up Röhner’s guestroom and then piercing the air mattress to cause a slow leak — to visions of an exploding coffee pot tearing off Röhner’s face.</p>

desc: `<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>2dcloud has never been afraid to publish books that don't neatly fit into categories, and Meynert's book is no exception. I believe it's best described as an illustrated prayer and invocation for healing. The lush illustrations, including delicate pencil drawings, elaborate design work and vibrant use of color, give the eye something powerful to work with when paired against the relatively spare use of text. The prayer is about staying open, staying aware, looking for help and looking for connections. There's a repeating visual motif of flowering amidst an open hand, representing perhaps that it's important to understand how to be open to the things life can offer you, that one's mental state is key to accepting or not accepting what life has to offer, in all of its incarnations. The comic is all about flow, fluidity and water's paradox in being droplets and a wave all at once. That metaphor is used to explain our position relative to others: we are all water, whether we realize it or not, and we can either flow or resist--but the river will always keep moving. —</span><a href="http://highlowcomics.blogspot.ca/2017/05/2dcloud-sprawling-heart-perfect-hair.html">Rob Clough</a><span></span><br><br><span>Meynert's work is both graphic and lush, whether it's a hand-printed zine or full-scale drawing. —</span><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/beta/arts/sab-meynert-tcaf-comics-1.3578900">CBC Arts</a><span></span><br><br><span>Sab Meynert is a Toronto illustrator whose works look like they could have been created digitally, but really they are meticulously rendered pen/marker drawings. —</span><a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/illustration/sab-meynerts-surreal-pen-drawings/">Juxtapoz</a></p>

<p><span>Sprawling Heart is an intimate musical of paper, paint, and ink. Inward rumination's reach outward as exhalation's and a whisper becomes a sumptuous song.</span><br><br><span>Sab Meynert is an artist &amp; writer based in Toronto, whose work has been recognized as a melodic counterpoint to the independent arts publishing sector. Their work spins poetic imagery &amp; text to weave maps of visceral emotions and the multiformity of life's infinitely unfolding nature. Between independently published artist multiples, national &amp; international gallery shows, grant-funded bodies of work, collaborative initiatives with high profile musicians &amp; artists, and their September world-distributed publishing debut, Sprawling Heart, Meynert is an embodiment of the artist working in dynamic multiplicity.</span></p>

<p class="alt">"Time Capsule is almost wordless, with the few passages that contain words functioning more as poetic framing devices or just lush expressions of a human trying to deal with the confusion of existence. Throughout the book there are letters and numbers rendered as drawings that become decorative design elements on the page, and though they occasionally remind me of where we came from, they also make me think of code, as if in Umber’s words, she is seeking an “innate algorithm [that] breaks down the world hungrily.” It’s this revolving door of collecting and processing with no ultimate sense to come from the endeavor that I find both mysterious and compelling."<span> —</span><strong><a href="http://www.tcj.com/reviews/time-capsule/">The Comics Journal</a></strong><br></p>

<p class="alt">Dinski is an astute observer of the human condition, transcribing our fears, anxieties, delusions and desperation in his every line, taking care to remind us of the humor that can be found in one's ongoing struggle with the myriad impediments inherent in our species.<br>— Joshua W. Cotter<br><br>Dinski has created a comic that explores the fundamental brokenness of people and the whitewash surfaces we paint over them.<span> </span><a href="https://sequentialstate.com/?s=Trying+Not+to+Notice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sequential State</a><br><br>Are you a conservative?<span> </span><a href="http://www.adamgriffiths.ink/zinetree_wdinski.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zine Tree</a><br><br></p>
</div>
<div class="col6 padem13h">
<p class="alt">Will Dinski's new book is one of his best. One of Dinski's go-to themes has been the ways in which people's lives become intertwined in unexpected and frequently toxic ways. In Trying Not To Notice, each of its four chapters are told from the point of view of one of four principal characters: a struggling stand-up comedian named John, his grizzled veteran comic friend Kyle; John's wife Amanda, who is unable to use her legs; and John's co-worker Summer. At first, it's not clear who's leading the narrative with each chapter title; for example, the first chapter is "My friend Kyle has it all figured out." It takes a couple of pages before it's clear that while the title refers to John's relationship with Kyle, it's all from Kyle's point of view.<span> </span><a href="http://highlowcomics.blogspot.com/2017/01/2dcloud-will-dinskis-trying-not-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Clough</a></p>

<p><span>"Where did this man come from? [...] lines so delicate they’re like hairs that have dropped onto a scanner from above. Who knew making a series of pictures in navy triangles and circles could be so beautiful?" —<strong>It’s Nice That</strong></span></p>
<p><span>"We often expect comics to tell us the stories of adventures. Alexis Beauclair does precisely this and nothing else, but his work extends, synthesizes, crystallizes, refines and intensifies this tradition. "Action" is the watchword of his narratives, which follow the path of looking and the stages of perception to reconstitute the movement of an intelligence. Alexis Beauclair's comics tell us the story of the adventure of drawing. And (almost) nothing else." —<strong>Laurent Bruel</strong>, Editions Matière</span><br></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>"Alexis Beauclair's minimalism makes generous play of the act of reading comics. Recalling the lively abstract animation of Viking Eggeling, Oskar Fischinger, and Al Jarnow, Beauclair's formalism is intellectual but never academic. His precise, linear images reveal themselves to be shaded with humor and humanity in their juxtaposition and arrangement." —<strong>Bill Kartalopoulos</strong>, Series Editor for the #1 New York Times best selling Best American Comics series</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>The Sol LeWitt of comics delivers sublime beauty of abstract art as never before in a graphic novel.<br><br>Nothing stretches or bends, there is no movement, no animation, no life in static images. But by looking at these pared-down and simple pictures in sequence, you catch glimpses that would indicate otherwise—and that indication is magical. Before your eyes, these abstract simple lines, geometric shapes, and grids come to life. Vanishing Perspective is a comic book in which the reader is light itself.</span></p>

<p>The schoolhouse is filling with drowning children. Bizarre and garish colors dominate this surreal high school story. Breutzman's rubbery realism reminds one of characters from Daniel Clowes’ Eightball, while the narrative contains elements of overwhelming dread not unlike a Todd Solondz film, and the vivid colors evoke the work of a Lauren Weinstein comic. Yearbooks was given an honorable mention in the Neil Gaiman edited Best American Comics 2010.</p>
<p>Yearbooks made several 'Best of Lists': The Comics Journal's Top 50 Comics of 2009 at #24, File Under Other's Best of 2009, Cartoonist Noah Van Sciver described it as one of his favorite comics of 2010 on Inkstuds</p>
