"In her debut graphic novel The Whale, 22-year-old artist Aidan Koch manages to conjure up some major emotions with barely any words. Instead, her drawings take center stage. It's the first release from Gaze Books, an indie publishing company recently founded by comic artist Blaise Larmee. In Koch's book, we're presented with issues like love, loss, and dealing with harsh realities, all within the context of nature. Trust us, it's a complex story under a deceptively simple guise. Plus, it's only about 60 pages- the perfect length, because this is one book that begs to be read over and over again."

"This material is going to click hard with a group of people who just aren't getting the comics that might speak to them elsewhere."
