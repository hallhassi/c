i hate to admit, i wrote that because i opened your book and it was the first thing i saw. but it hit something. i was thinking, you were trying to not only -- not walk away -- not only walk away but take my friends with me! but ... i'm happy ... i dreamt we were in a car that broke on its way up to a bridge and i get out and start pushing (i'm on the driver's side) and you get out and -- no you stay in the car and drive. and then we're on a bus (or before) and i say it must be nice to babysit. you are very foreign to me. alien. unknown. i worry in two ways. one is you're very either fit or capable of fitness or both rather. the other is this hesitation i have around you -- a carefulness.
